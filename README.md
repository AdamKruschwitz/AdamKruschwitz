Hello! I'm Adam, I'm a web developer from NY, currently looking for remote work in the Bay Area California.

I'm currently enrolled in the UC Berkley full stack development code bootcamp, with an academic average of A+. I'm looking for remote work as a web developer.

I recently graduated from the UC Berkeley full-stack web development bootcamp with an A+, and accolades from my instructors and peers. Before that I worked as a Support Engineer for an SaaS company called ZL Technologies, and before that I graduated from Ithaca College with a BA in Computer Science. 

I'm currently learning AWS through self study, and I'm working on a new project Teachback, a tutorial platform for development teams.
