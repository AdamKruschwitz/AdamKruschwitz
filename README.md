# Adam Kruschwitz

Hello! I'm Adam, I'm a web developer from NY, currently studying in the Bay Area California.

I'm currently enrolled in the UC Berkley full stack development code bootcamp, with an academic average of A+. I'm looking for remote work as a web developer.

I am currently working with a team on a new project called Teachback, a markdown tutorial platform geared towards demonstrating new tools for your team.
