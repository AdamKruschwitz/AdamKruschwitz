# Adam Kruschwitz

Hello! I'm Adam, I'm a web developer from NY, currently studying in the Bay Area California.

I'm currently enrolled in the UC Berkley full stack development code bootcamp, with an academic average of A+. I'm looking for remote work as a web developer.

Currently, I'm working on a web game tentatively called "Block Paint", a movement puzzle where you roll around as a block and paint a grid to match a given image.
